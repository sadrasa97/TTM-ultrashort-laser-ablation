# TTM-ultrashort-laser-ablation
ultrashort laer ablation of metals(NICKEL) with twotemperature model 
laser ablation is It is one of the strangest phenomena of physics.
This process is non-equilibrium due to the very short time of energy transfer to the target,
and due to its special features, it has countless applications in industry and medicine.
